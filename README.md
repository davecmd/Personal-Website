TODO: 
- Improve flare(animations,colour...etc) 
- Finish Cards (pop up a modal with a clickable link to the github if available)
- Clean up css html
- Cleanup file system

BUGS:
 - hypertext link for email animation glitches (maybe switch to using div?)
 - navigation bar jumps up in the half way point
 - fix in between screen size formats
 - if dark mode is saved in cookies, animation on toggle theme button plays on load and email. Also can randomly flicker white on load
 - Resume sometimes fails to load in properly
